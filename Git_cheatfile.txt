Workflow
The “normal” workflow when using Git on your own is;
git pull %new versions from the cloud repository
%%Now make changes to your files as you would normally.%%
git commit -a %your changes.
git status %to ensure that your working directory is clean.
git push %to push your changes back up to the cloud.

Workflow (multi-user)
A good workflow when working on a shared GitHub repository is
git status %to ensure your working directory is clean. If it isn’t, then clean it up and git commit -a any changes.
git pull %the latest changes from other people. If there are any conflicts, then merge them now, then git commit -a and git push the merges to the cloud.
%%Make changes to your files as you want.%%
git commit -a %your changes, and use git status to then ensure that your working directory is clean.
git pull %to pull in any changes that anyone else has made while you were working. If there are any conflicts, then resolve those conflicts and git commit -a until your working directory is clean.
%%When git pull causes no changes and git status shows your working directory is clean, then use git push to push your work to the cloud repository.

% Initialise directory and push
git init 
git status
git add .
git commit -a
git push

git diff % to see difference since last commit
git log -n 3 % to see available versions of working directory (limit to 3)
git checkout XXX(ID from git log) README.md % change back to x version of working directory
git checkout master README.md % return back to master version 
git mv something.md background.md % rename

mkdir subdir	%make subdirectory
touch subdir/empty_file.md %make file .md

ls .git

% push remote directory
git remote add origin https://github.com/s-yip/summer_2019.git
git push -u origin master

% branching from master
o-o-o-o-o-o
 `o
git checkout XXX(ID from git log)
git checkout -b new-branch
git add .
git commit -a
o-o-o-o-o-o  master
 `o          new-branch

% ignore tracking versions 
nano .gitignore and add name of file
